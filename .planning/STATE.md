# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-22 with v13 active)

**Core value:** Automated video production from any input — get social-media-ready videos at scale, distributed as a true downloadable desktop product priced for indie creators.
**Current focus:** Phase 80 — library-routes-repository-migration

## Current Position

Phase: 80 (library-routes-repository-migration) — COMPLETE (ready for verification)
Plan: 3 of 3 complete
Milestone: **v13 Desktop Production-Ready & Monetization** — OPENED 2026-05-22, 0/19 phases complete (Phase 80 awaiting verification).
Next action: `/gsd-audit-uat 80` to verify Phase 80, then `/gsd-next` to advance to Phase 81.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v13 product decisions (recorded 2026-05-22):

- **Milestone scope**: single large milestone (19 phases) covering functional fixes + monetization. User accepted scope over advisor's recommendation to split.
- **Marketing app location**: `marketing/` subfolder in this repo. Independent `package.json`, port 3001, separate Supabase project.
- **Pricing model**: BYOAK lifetime + Cloud Sync — Starter $79 one-time, Pro $149 one-time, Cloud Sync $39/yr.
- **Code signing**: deferred to v14. v13 ships unsigned with SmartScreen explainer in onboarding.
- **ML features**: optional post-install ~1.5GB bundle download (PyTorch + Silero + Whisper + Coqui XTTS). Base installer ≤ 550MB.
- **Auth pattern**: OAuth 2.0 device flow with PKCE (RFC 7636), tokens in OS keychain via `keyring`. Mirrors Claude Code / `gh` / AWS CLI.
- **Existing web app**: untouched. All monetization work goes into `marketing/`.

Earlier project decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Phase 80]: Plan 80-01 deferred site #23 (_regenerate_voiceover_task body) to Plan 80-02 — audit gap discovered during execution, 7+ in-body supabase.table() calls beyond the get_client() guard would have caused NameError if migrated piecemeal
- [Phase 80]: Plan 80-01 added 5 new ABC methods (count_clips, get_export_preset_by_name, delete_exports_older_than, get_project_by_name, increment_segment_usage) on both backends and migrated 18 Pattern A/B routes in library_routes.py — get_client() count reduced from 27 to 9 (the Pattern C/D residual handed to 80-02)
- [Phase 80]: Plan 80-02: get_client() count driven to 0 in library_routes.py; both grep gates pass (get_client = 0 AND supabase.table/.rpc = 0); deviations driven by second-gate necessity (5 unenumerated calls in _generate_from_segments_task, full _regenerate_voiceover_task migration, dead 503 guard removal)
- [Phase 80]: Plan 80-03: sqlite_backend fixture + 23 per-route SQLite integration tests in test_api_library_sqlite.py (all pass) + 11 xfail markers on broken Supabase-mocked tests; 0 regressions in wider suite. 3 route-side bugs (tts_text vs script_text column mismatch, missing timedelta import, missing Request param on SlowAPI route) filed as follow-up work — out of scope for Phase 80.

### Pending Todos

None at milestone level — phase-level planning starts at `/gsd-discuss-phase 80`.

### Blockers/Concerns

Inherited from v12, all targeted for resolution in v13:

- 88 backend sites still call `repo.get_client()` (returns None under `DATA_BACKEND=sqlite`) — covered by Phases 80–83.
- Gemini singleton refresh not called after API key save — likely addressed during route migration (Phase 81).
- `frontend/.env.local` with real Supabase key committed to repo — security concern, address as gap closure.
- DB migrations 007/009/017/021/023/024 require manual application — review during Phase 84 (cross-platform paths).

New for v13:

- Lemon Squeezy webhook signing secret + Supabase project for `marketing/` need to be provisioned before Phase 91 starts.
- GitHub Actions `release.yml` needs `GH_TOKEN` with write-releases scope before Phase 96.
- macOS FFmpeg binary needs to be added to repo or fetched in CI — Phase 84.
- Resend (or equivalent) API key for license-key emails — Phase 91.
