## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v6 Roadmap: Phase 24 (backend stability) is prerequisite — phases 25, 26, 28 can run in parallel after it completes
- v6 Roadmap: Phase 27 (frontend refactoring) depends on Phase 26 (resilience patterns in place first)
- 24-01: In-memory dict is primary progress source; Supabase is durability layer — all DB calls try/except so DB outage never blocks generation
- 24-01: 409 Conflict returned at endpoint level (not inside background task) via is_project_locked() non-blocking check
- 24-01: editai_generation_progress uses TEXT PK for project_id to match backend string UUID usage

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Database migrations pending:**
- Migration 007 (v3 encoding presets) requires manual application via Supabase SQL Editor
- Migration 009 (v4 TTS timestamps) requires manual application via Supabase SQL Editor
- Migration 017 (editai_generation_progress) requires manual application via Supabase SQL Editor
