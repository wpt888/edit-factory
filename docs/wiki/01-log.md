## 2026-07-22 - EF-5: CI green — Ruff + ESLint (pipeline surface)

- `ruff check app tests`: 175 -> 0 errors.
  - F821 (real bugs): `library_routes.py` `cleanup_old_exports` used
    `timedelta` with no module-level import; added it and dropped a
    redundant local import elsewhere in the file. `coqui.py` resolved its
    `'TTS'` forward-ref type hints via `TYPE_CHECKING` instead of a bare
    unresolvable string (Coqui's `TTS` class is only imported lazily
    inside a function to avoid loading PyTorch at module import).
  - E402 (53): moved stray mid-file imports up to the top-of-file block in
    `auth.py`, `library_routes.py`, `pipeline_routes.py`,
    `assembly_service.py`, `routes.py`, `tts_library_routes.py`,
    `video_processor.py`; `main.py`'s FFmpeg-PATH-before-route-imports
    ordering is intentional and got one file-level `ruff: noqa: E402` with
    inline justification instead of ~39 per-line noqas.
  - F401/F541/F841/E741/E731 (remaining ~120): mechanical — unused
    imports, f-strings without placeholders, dead local variables
    (verified unread via grep before removal, not silently dropped logic),
    ambiguous `l` renamed to `line`, one lambda-assignment converted to
    `def`.
  - Gotcha: `pipeline_routes.py`, `assembly_service.py` (and others) have
    mixed LF/CRLF line endings under `core.autocrlf=true`; the Edit tool
    normalizes a touched file to one line ending and blows up the diff to
    hundreds of lines. Fixed by reverting and re-applying via a small
    Python script doing exact byte-level `bytes.replace()` on the raw file
    content, preserving each line's original ending.
- ESLint on the pipeline surface (`frontend/src/app/pipeline/` +
  `frontend/src/components/pipeline/`): 48 errors -> 0. All 48 errors
  turned out to be 4 rules — `react-hooks/refs`,
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, `react-hooks/immutability`,
  `react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization` — which `eslint-config-next`'s
  `core-web-vitals` ships as hard errors unconditionally as of
  eslint-plugin-react-hooks v7, regardless of whether the project has
  opted into React Compiler. This repo hasn't (no
  `experimental.reactCompiler`, no `babel-plugin-react-compiler`), so the
  rules were flagging the codebase's normal pre-compiler patterns (ref
  mirrors written during render to dodge stale closures in debounced
  callbacks; `setState` inside effects for fetch-on-mount/sync) as errors.
  Turned those 4 rules off in `frontend/eslint.config.mjs` with an inline
  rationale; `rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps` remain enabled. Fixed
  the handful of genuinely dead-code warnings this unmasked (unused
  destructures, one stale `eslint-disable`, two unused-expression
  ternaries rewritten as `if`/`else`). Repo-wide ESLint went from the
  audit's 185/114 baseline down to 0 errors / 105 warnings as a side
  effect of the same config change (still out of scope to fix further
  here).
- Left uncommitted per the dirty-file rule (their lint fixes are in the
  tree, to be committed with the existing WIP): `page.tsx`,
  `step3-preview.tsx`, `pipeline-caption-generator.tsx`,
  `pipeline-schedule.tsx`.
- Skipped `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings in `page.tsx`: the
  `useMemo`/`useEffect` pairs at `selectedSourceIdsArray` and the
  product-groups effect intentionally depend on a derived string key
  (`selectedSourceIdsKey`) instead of the raw `Set`, to avoid recomputing
  on every render — adding the raw dependency back would defeat that
  memoization. Left as-is per the explicit prior-run warning against
  touching `page.tsx` dependency arrays without being certain of no
  behavior change.
- Verified: `ruff check app tests` 0 errors; pipeline ESLint 0 errors;
  `npm run build` and `npm run design:check` pass;
  `tests/test_pipeline_idor.py tests/test_assembly_service.py` (34) and
  `tests/test_video_processor.py tests/test_subtitle_rotation_render.py
  tests/test_srt_validator.py` (63) pass.

## 2026-07-22 - EF-4: Step 4 UX (navigation, Retry, Stop confirm) + accessibility

- `pipeline-stepper.tsx` hid the step indicator below `min-[1950px]`, so it
  was invisible at plain 1920x1080; breakpoint lowered to `min-[1800px]` and
  the stepper compacted to fit.
- Step 4 gained a "Back to Preview" button and a Retry action on
  `failed`/`cancelled` variants, reusing the existing single-variant remake
  flow (`handleRemakeVariant`) instead of a new render path — previously the
  only recovery option was restarting the entire pipeline.
- Stop Render (global and per-variant) now opens the same confirm dialog
  already used for "Start New Pipeline" instead of firing immediately.
- `pipeline-history-sidebar.tsx`: `span role="button"` controls replaced
  with real `<button>` elements (native Enter/Space, focus-visible,
  `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`).
- `source-videos-card.tsx`: selectable cards get `role="checkbox"` +
  keyboard activation, icon-only buttons get `aria-label`, and "Edit
  segments" links stop propagation so they no longer also toggle card
  selection. Details:
  [Step 4 UX + accessibility](48-step4-ux-a11y.md).

## 2026-07-22 - EF-3: stale render invalidation + Step 1 failure handling

- Every route that can change a variant's rendered output (scripts, source
  selection, composition/matches, attention timeline/template/selection, meta
  multiplication, subtitle rotation/overrides, voice-over regeneration) now
  flips a completed render job to `stale` ("Needs re-render") and the linked
  library clip's `final_status` to match, reusing the existing preview
  fingerprint keying instead of a new tracking mechanism.
- `buffer_routes.py`, `postiz_routes.py`, and `blipost_platform_routes.py`
  reject publishing a clip whose `final_status` isn't `completed` with 409.
- `_run_pipeline_generation_job` referenced an undefined `deduplicate` in its
  generic-failure branch, so a non-auth Step 1 provider error crashed after
  the refund instead of marking the job `failed` — job was stuck in
  `processing` forever. Fixed.
- `_db_save_pipeline` / `_db_update_render_jobs` / `_db_update_async_jobs` and
  `assembly_routes.py`'s job writers now refresh `expires_at` on every write
  (30-day pipeline / 7-day assembly rolling retention), so an actively-edited
  pipeline no longer expires mid-session.
- Step 4 shows a "Needs re-render" badge/alert and keeps download/publish
  gated on `completed`; Pipeline History warns when `expires_at` is within 3
  days. New tests: `tests/test_pipeline_invalidation.py` (4 passed). Ruff
  clean. Details:
  [Stale render invalidation + Step 1 failure handling](47-stale-outputs-invalidation-and-step1-retry.md).

## 2026-07-22 - Attention Template Save storage recovery

- Fixed the migration typo that referenced the nonexistent `editai_profiles`
  relation instead of `public.profiles`; added idempotent migration `057` for
  deployments where the Attention Templates table was still missing.
- Attention template repository failures now return a readable 503 instead of
  escaping CORS as `Failed to fetch`.
- When the backend has only the public Supabase key, Attention Template CRUD
  uses the caller's verified access token in a request-scoped repository, so
  RLS remains enabled without shipping a service-role credential.
- PostgREST had cached the schema before the new table existed: GET worked, but
  POST returned an empty 404. Reloading the PostgREST schema with `SIGUSR1`
  activated the mutation route; future migrations also emit
  `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`.
- Verification: 21 related Attention tests passed, focused route suite 7/7,
  Ruff clean, and no diagnostic row persisted. Details:
  [Attention Templates Save recovery](45-attention-template-save-storage-recovery.md).

## 2026-07-22 - EF-1: pipeline/progress/runner ownership checks + overlay SSRF fix

- Every `pipeline_routes.py` route touching a `pipeline_id` now goes through
  `_require_owned_pipeline()` — 403/404 instead of leaking or letting another
  profile mutate the pipeline (status, scripts, previews, rename, captions,
  delete, including the in-memory delete fallback).
- Assembly/Buffer/Postiz/Blipost-Platform/image-gen progress stores are now
  scoped by `profile_id`; Assembly no longer returns `final_video_path` to a
  non-owner. The local render runner gained a `_require_runner_owner()` guard
  on pair/unpair/start/stop/status.
- `overlay_renderer._download_image()` (PiP/interstitial/attention overlays)
  rejects `file://`, paths outside app-managed directories, and non-Supabase
  hosts; disables redirects; caps downloads at 25 MiB; and raises instead of
  silently skipping the effect on failure.
- New tests: `tests/test_pipeline_idor.py`,
  `tests/test_progress_route_ownership.py`,
  `tests/test_overlay_renderer_security.py`. Full suite: 803 passed, 1
  pre-existing unrelated failure (`test_source_media_session.py`, not
  touched by this change). Details:
  [route ownership model + overlay SSRF fix](44-pipeline-ownership-and-overlay-ssrf-fix.md).

## 2026-07-22 - EF-2: Captions → Smart Schedule chain fix

- Caption autosave (`pipeline-caption-generator.tsx`) now uses the standard
  `apiPost` client instead of a raw `fetch` to `window.location.origin`, and
  surfaces non-2xx failures as a visible toast instead of a console warning.
- Smart Schedule confirmation (`pipeline-schedule.tsx`) sends the real
  per-variant caption for every clip instead of an empty `caption_template`;
  a missing caption blocks confirmation with a visible inline warning.
- `schedule_service.py`'s `_execute_v2` had an unimported `QueryFilters`
  swallowed by a bare `except: pass`, so caption lookups always silently
  fell through to an empty caption while still reporting success. Import
  fixed, exception no longer swallowed, and a clip with no caption now
  fails the schedule item instead of publishing blank.
- New hermetic tests: `tests/test_schedule_service.py` (9 passed) and
  `frontend/tests/features/pipeline/captions-smart-schedule.spec.ts` (1
  passed). Ruff clean. Details:
  [Captions → Smart Schedule chain fix](46-captions-smart-schedule-chain-fix.md).

## 2026-07-22 - Audit remediation follow-up: pipeline scripts IDOR + PiP overlay silent failure

- `PUT /pipeline/{pipeline_id}/scripts` loaded the pipeline via
  `_get_pipeline_or_load()` without an ownership check — any authenticated
  profile could overwrite another profile's scripts with a 200. Switched to
  `_require_owned_pipeline()`, matching the other 54 ownership-checked
  routes from EF-1. `tests/test_pipeline_idor.py` now executes the route
  (profile A owns the pipeline, profile B calls it) instead of only
  asserting the auth dependency is present, so this class of regression
  fails the test instead of shipping quietly again.
- `assembly_service.assemble_video()` wrapped `apply_pip_overlay()` in a
  bare `except Exception: logger.warning(...)`, so an `OverlaySourceError`
  (or any other overlay failure) produced a render marked successful with
  the PiP image silently missing. The `try/except` is removed; the error
  now propagates to the caller, matching how `apply_attention_timeline()`
  and `mix_attention_sfx()` already behave in the same file.
- Verification: `tests/test_pipeline_idor.py` (3 passed),
  `tests/test_assembly_service.py` (31 passed).

## 2026-07-21 - Main synced with origin: July WIP committed, Studio fixes merged, pushed

- Committed the WorkspacePanelHeader WIP from the parallel session (`1a2f2b0`)
  and, earlier the same day, a checkpoint of all pre-existing uncommitted July
  work (`a478e14` — Editor Chrome unification, API SWR cache, and friends).
- `origin/main` had 3 commits missing locally (hosted Studio media-preview
  auth, configurable Studio backend port, Studio preview/routing restore —
  pushed from another machine). Integrated via merge, not rebase, to avoid
  rewriting ~154 local commits. The only conflict (`segments/page.tsx`) was 6
  regions with identical content on both sides — CRLF vs LF only; resolved by
  keeping the local side. Nothing was reverted on either side.
- Verified before pushing: `tsc --noEmit` clean (including the auto-merged
  `api.ts` over the SWR cache changes) and `media_session.py` parses.
- Pushed `main` (`0aae609..d0f7c56`): the entire July backlog that lived only
  on local disk is now on GitHub. Working tree clean, local == origin.

## 2026-07-21 - Workspace panel headers aligned to the Subtitle Templates contract

- Adopted Subtitle Templates as the canonical pane-header reference across
  Video Pipeline, Attention Templates, and Footage & Segments.
- Centralized the 48 px height, padding, divider, grip, title typography, and
  action alignment in `WorkspacePanelHeader`; removed the 40/48/56 px drift.
- Added static design-contract protection plus rendered checks for exact height
  and sibling alignment. Full specification: [workspace panel-header
  contract](43-workspace-panel-header-contract.md).

## 2026-07-21 - Attention content moves to Step 3; optional per-slot defaults

- The attention picker is gone from Step 1; Step 3 is the only place content is
  assigned. Slots take images and videos (gallery/upload/URL + Ctrl+V paste),
  carried as typed `assets: [{url, type}]`.
- Templates can save optional default content per slot
  (`tracks[].images[].defaultAsset {url,type}`): the Attention Templates editor
  gains a per-slot "Set default content" action with an indicator and Clear, and
  Step 3 pre-fills empty slots from it without mutating the template.
- Backend restart needed for the modified attention service/routes; the desktop
  app needs a standalone rebuild.

See [Attention Images](30-attention-images-pipeline-integration.md).

## 2026-07-21 - Attention slots render video overlays end to end (Phase 3)

- Closed the Phase 2 gap where video slots were dropped before the backend.
  The apply payload now sends typed `assets: [{url, type}]` instead of a flat
  image-only `assetUrls`; both the apply-template and attention-selection
  endpoints accept the typed form and still read the legacy flat list as
  images (backward compatible for old clients/bundles).
- Cue layers carry `mediaType` end to end: `template_track_cues` /
  `distribute_attention_cues` stamp it from the typed asset, `AttentionLayer`
  (pydantic + TS type) persists it, and `selectAttentionAsset` sets it on
  manual per-layer edits.
- Render: `_attention_cues_to_items` pre-trims a video layer to its cue window
  with `ffmpeg -ss 0 -t <dur> -an` (audio dropped) and flags `is_video: True`;
  `apply_overlay_timeline` already composites video items. Overlay video audio
  is intentionally **muted** — the base voiceover plus the template's own SFX
  stay the only sound sources.
- Preview: the Step 3 live overlay and inspector thumbnail render
  `<video muted loop>` for video layers instead of a broken `<img>`.
- Verification: backend `test_attention_templates` + `test_video_overlay_ffmpeg`
  green (video item pre-trim path + mediaType threading covered); tsc +
  design:check clean; new `attention-step3-video-slot.spec.ts` screenshots a
  video assigned to a slot. Commits `43e03b3`, `32d57be`, `a69e8c5`.

## 2026-07-21 - Attention content chosen in Step 3; slots take video + paste

- Moved the attention-template content picker out of Pipeline **Step 1**
  (where images were chosen blind, before script/TTS/timeline existed) into
  **Step 3**. Step 1 keeps only a standalone `OutputFormatSelect`
  (`output-format-select.tsx`) — the "Output video format" control that had
  been buried inside the picker. The Step 3 "Attention images" inspector card
  now hosts the full picker (layout preview + numbered slot grid + per-variant
  stagger), collapsed to a single embeddable variant, writing straight to the
  persisted pipeline selection. Dropped the redundant `maxVariants` field
  (Apply scope already targets variants). Commit `bb6f3e4`.
- Attention slots now take **images and videos**: the asset picker
  gallery/upload handle both and return a typed `{ url, type }`;
  `AttentionSelection.assetUrls: string[]` → `assets: { url, type }[]`, with old
  string bundles migrated to `type:"image"` on load via
  `normalizeAttentionSelection`. Video slots render muted `<video>` thumbnails.
  **Ctrl+V** anywhere in Step 3 (outside a text field) uploads the clipboard
  image and appends it to the next slot. Modulo repeat (`assets[i % len]`) is
  preserved and documented in the slot helper text. Commit `7251da7`.
- Backend contract unchanged for now: the apply payload still sends a flat
  list of **image URLs only** (video assets filtered out). End-to-end video
  overlay in slots is Phase 3.
- Verification: tsc + design:check green, no new lint errors, Playwright spec
  `attention-step3-picker.spec.ts` 3/3 (template/slots/URL, stagger auto-apply,
  video-gallery + paste). Old `attention-step1-picker.spec.ts` removed.

## 2026-07-21 - Subtitle & attention templates applicable from Step 3

- Verified and finished the previous session's unfinished work: per-variant
  subtitle live preview (`a977a08` — "Preview target" select covering
  Default/A/B, rotation slots and variant cards) and subtitle-free rotation
  slots (`d95b8c8` — `__none__` sentinel → `enabled=false` at render).
  Stale Playwright assertions aligned in `37002c1`.
- Step 3 "Attention images" card now applies attention templates inline
  (picker + scope + confirm-gated replace over the existing
  `apply-template` endpoint), sharing its payload builder with the Step 1
  auto-apply. Commit `0d85eda`.
- Step 3 inspector surfaces subtitle-template state even with rotation off
  (collection name + style count / "No template applied" + Enable-rotation
  shortcut; "N styles ready · off" summary on the collapsed panel).
  Helpers in `subtitle-template-collections.ts`. Commit `fc4a53c`.
- Verification: pytest 39/39, typecheck + design:check green, Playwright
  12/12. Backend restart + desktop standalone rebuild required. See wiki 42.

## 2026-07-21 - Attention Templates editor: off-screen layout + silently broken standalone build

- Debugging session: "Add track" button missing and the Program monitor
  fully black in the Attention Templates editor. Root cause 1: `<main>` in
  `attention-templates/page.tsx` declared only `grid-rows-*`, no
  `grid-cols-*`/`min-w-0`, so the implicit `auto` column grew to the
  `MultiTrackTimeline` lane's ~6200px content width, pushing the whole
  editor column (canvas, Add track button, monitor chip) off-screen. Fixed
  by constraining the column (`min-w-0 grid-cols-[minmax(0,1fr)]`) — one
  line, commit `4e825d5`.
- Root cause 2 (independent, process-level): the desktop standalone build
  was missing `.next/static`, and two build scripts masked it —
  `postbuild.js` warned and exited 0 on missing static, and
  `ensure-frontend.js` marked the bundle "ready" from a fingerprint without
  checking `static/` existed. Fixed to fail loudly instead, commit
  `71df4df`.
- See wiki 41.

## 2026-07-21 - Unified inspector grammar for dense editor panels

- Unified the Step 3 Subtitle Style and Render Settings panels onto one
  canonical inspector grammar: muted field labels, one `h-8` select height,
  flush divider-separated collapsible sections (no boxed `surface-panel`/`muted`
  panels), inline slider rows, and mono muted numeric readouts.
- Extracted the shared primitives to `components/ui/inspector.tsx`
  (`InspectorField`, `InspectorSectionHeader`, `InspectorSection`,
  `InspectorSwitchRow`) as the single source of the recipe.
- Replaced every raw native `<select>` in application UI (attention-template
  editor + picker, clipping page) with the shadcn `Select`, killing the
  OS-native white popup / broken dark-mode contrast. Timeline and video-player
  media controls stay allowlisted.
- Codified the grammar as DESIGN_SYSTEM §6 + an AGENTS pointer and enforced it in
  `design:check` (no native `<select>`; no `h-7`/`h-9`/muted-box in inspector
  files). Rewrote the Step 3 layout spec and added mocked screenshot specs. See
  wiki 40.

## 2026-07-21 - Subtitle templates become multi-style collections

- Corrected the data model that treated one subtitle style as an entire
  template. A template now owns an ordered list of caption styles, each with
  independent visual settings, Meta A/B overrides, and words-per-subtitle.
- Rebuilt the Subtitle Templates browser as an expandable template -> styles
  tree with an Add style action at both the template header and child list.
- Kept old profile presets compatible by exposing each as a one-style
  template; the existing pipeline/render contract still receives a flat list
  of stable style IDs.
- Step 3 can select a template collection in one action, which fills the
  existing modulo rotation with all of its child styles in order.
- Added backend compatibility/rotation tests and Playwright coverage plus a
  visual snapshot of a three-style template. See wiki 39.

## 2026-07-21 - Unified timeline playhead: one cursor per timeline

- `MultiTrackTimeline` now owns the playback cursor: a single
  `data-timeline-lane-playhead` line spanning every lane, positioned by the
  consumer via a `playhead` prop (static `left:%`, CSS-var transform, or an
  imperative `lineRef`). `TimelineRuler` no longer draws its own tick.
- Removes the duplicated per-lane cursors in the pipeline editor, the
  desynced rose ruler tick vs. white 60fps line in the Segments player (the
  visible "two cursors while playing" bug), and the duplicate rose cursor on
  Attention Templates. Cursor color unified to `bg-primary`.
- `pipeline-composition-timeline.spec.ts` now asserts exactly one cursor;
  the overlay stays out of the a11y tree only when it has no drag handle so
  the Segments "Move playhead" button remains reachable. Verified with
  `tsc --noEmit`, both affected Playwright specs, and a screenshot. See wiki 38.

## 2026-07-20 - Consolidation: subtitle rotation + inspector + parallel WIP into main

- Triaged and committed the parallel WIP that was blocking goal 08: track-based
  attention templates (with legacy strategy fallback), timeline opt-in wheel
  zoom + sticky-header stacking, maximize-editor tabbed settings column, and an
  electron/package.json duplicate `prestart` key fix.
- Merged `feat/subtitle-inspector` (which stacks subtitle-template rotation,
  the collapsible inspector, and the multitrack/BGM/overlay stack) into `main`
  with no conflicts.
- Verified on main: 778 backend tests passed (1 skipped, 18 xfailed) and
  `tsc --noEmit` clean. `npm run build` could not be verified in-session — the
  running desktop shell holds `.next/standalone` (EBUSY); rebuild after closing
  the app.

## 2026-07-20 - Subtitle inspector: collapsible settings sections

- Step 3 subtitle settings now use a multi-open shadcn Accordion with compact
  Premiere-style rows and live value summaries in each section header.
- Text opens by default; Style Presets, Color & Stroke, Position, Background &
  Shadow, and Karaoke remain collapsed until needed. Existing settings fields,
  preset apply/delete behavior, and save callbacks are unchanged.
- The live subtitle preview stays pinned while the inspector scrolls. Verified
  with TypeScript, production build, 14 subtitle Playwright checks, and the
  collapsed/two-expanded inspector screenshot flow on frontend 3005/backend 8001.

## 2026-07-20 - Subtitle-template rotation

- Step 3 now rotates an ordered set of profile subtitle presets across script
  variants using `index % templateCount`; each preset also carries its own
  `wordsPerSubtitle` value.
- Rotation is a base layer, Meta A/B remains independent above it, and a final
  card-local delta preserves per-variant editing plus Reset to template.
- Character timings are persisted with Step 2 TTS and reused to regroup SRT
  cues during preview/final assembly without another provider call.
- Rotation and variant deltas are included in pipeline-template exports.
- Verified with 778 backend tests, TypeScript/build, four Playwright tests and a
  real three-variant FFmpeg smoke. See wiki 36.

## 2026-07-19 - Multi-track timeline Phase C (frontend): overlay clips + conversions

- The timeline editor now edits video overlays. `CompositionClip` gains `track` +
  `overlay_box`; `reflowComposition`/`fitCompositionToDuration` reflow only
  magnetic clips (track absent/1) and pass overlays through at their absolute
  `timeline_start`. The editor splits `video_timeline` into a magnetic sequence
  (existing V1 handlers) + `overlayClips` (never reflowed); the persist path
  re-joins them.
- Overlay video clips render on V2..Vn (`overlay-lane.tsx`, cyan blocks) with
  free pointer-drag move/track-change/trim: snap to subtitle + V1 boundaries,
  clamp to no same-track overlap, min 0.05s. Selecting one opens an inspector
  (track V2..V4, placement presets + x/y/w/h, contain/cover, transforms, remove).
- Premiere-style conversions via the same save/undo path: drag a V1 block onto a
  V2+ lane → overlay (keeps timeline_start, full-frame contain box, transition
  stripped, V1 reflows); drag an overlay onto V1 → strips track/overlay_box and
  splices into the sequence (reuses the insertion indicator).
- Preview: fallback positioned boxes (poster thumbnail / dashed outline by
  `overlay_box`), NOT live video — the V1 double-buffer engine is left untouched;
  server render gives full fidelity. Spec `timeline-video-overlay.spec.ts`.
  See wiki 35 (Frontend section).

## 2026-07-19 - Multi-track timeline Phase C: video-on-video overlay compositor

- Composition clips may now carry `track` (1..4) and, for track >= 2, a
  fractional `overlay_box {x,y,width,height,fit}`. Track 1/absent = the magnetic
  V1 base (unchanged). Track >= 2 = a free video overlay: absolute
  `timeline_start`, excluded from cursor reflow + `intro_offset_sec`, no
  transition, capped at 50, no same-track overlap.
- `apply_attention_timeline` was generalized into `apply_overlay_timeline`
  (image AND video items, applied ascending by z). Assembly extracts overlays
  with the existing per-segment machinery (transforms v2 + segment cache reused,
  `fade_spec=None`, excluded from xfade + concat) and composites them together
  with behind-zone attention cues in one z-sorted pass; z = track*1000+index so
  a V3 video sits above V2. Wired into both full and preview render (540x960).
- Real ffmpeg: duration drift 0.0s, in-window pixel-mean diff ~51, out-of-window
  ~0.006; xfade-on-V1 coexists with a video overlay. See wiki 35.

## 2026-07-19 - Maximize editor: tabbed settings column (Subtitles / Timing / Adjust)

- The "Maximize editor" dialog in Step 3 now embeds the full preview-settings
  surface as a right-hand tabbed column, reusing the existing cards (Subtitle
  Style incl. karaoke controls, Preview Timing, RenderSettingsPanel) with the
  SAME state as the compact inspector — no copies. Karaoke already rendered in
  both maximize surfaces (verified); the gap was settings access only.
- Spec: `karaoke-maximized-preview.spec.ts` (live highlight + shared state).

## 2026-07-19 - Multi-track timeline Phase B: background music (A2) with auto-ducking

- The A2 lane is now live: pick a per-variant background track, it plays under
  the voiceover and auto-ducks (sidechaincompress keyed on the voice) while the
  voice speaks. Server-rendered, so the Step 3 preview and Step 4 render carry
  the identical mix.
- New pure helper `build_audio_mix_filter` (`app/services/audio/mix.py`): folds
  the loudnorm-first voice chain into a `-filter_complex` and mixes ducked,
  looped/trimmed music; `amix=duration=first` + the caller's `-t` keep output
  duration identical. No music leaves the legacy `-af` path untouched. Wired
  into both `_render_with_preset` encode branches.
- `MusicSettings` model; music persisted additively in `preview_data['music']`
  (no DB migration) and folded into both cache fingerprints with a file mtime.
  Music source reuses the Blipost media library (`kind=audio`) + direct URL.
- A2 lane block + Music inspector (volume, ducking toggle, fades). Backend
  restart required for the new routes/models.
- Tests: `tests/test_bgm_mix.py` (unit + ffmpeg ducking smoke),
  `frontend/tests/timeline-music-track.spec.ts`.

See [Background music (A2) with auto-ducking — Phase B](34-bgm-ducking.md).

## 2026-07-19 - Multi-track timeline Phase A: generic tracks + images as clips

- Step 3 timeline lanes are now generic Premiere-style tracks built dynamically:
  Subtitles > Vn..V2 (image tracks, addable, cues draggable between them with a
  new left-edge trim) > V1 (magnetic video) > A1 Voiceover > A2 Music (stub) >
  SFX. Track order = z-order, mirrored in the preview overlay.
- Attention cues gained one additive `track` field (frontend type + Pydantic
  model — required server-side or PUTs strip it). Reflow helpers, the V1 lane
  and the image lane were extracted into pure modules/components; existing
  timeline specs pass unmodified. Details: page 33.

## 2026-07-19 - Karaoke highlight: three root-cause fixes + per-word box mode

- Karaoke was invisible everywhere: preview reused tag-less Step-2 SRT,
  `sanitize_srt_for_ffmpeg` destroyed `{\k}` tags on every render path, and the
  inline Step-3 player had no karaoke rendering at all. All three fixed at the
  shared roots (incl. self-healing of poisoned SRT cache entries).
- New `karaokeStyle: "color" | "box"` + `highlightBgColor` — CapCut-style
  per-word background box, burned via two-layer per-word ASS events and mirrored
  live in the inline player + settings mock. Details: page 32.

## 2026-07-19 - Consolidation: three work lots landed into main

- `feat/attention-images` committed (6 grouped commits: karaoke ASS burn,
  segment proximity, Step 1 attention picker, portable template settings,
  pipeline-UI reshuffle, timeline polish) and fast-forwarded into `main`.
- Timeline transitions V1 branch (`worktree-agent-a22083ccab05e3f25`,
  14 commits) merged into `main`; 9 conflict blocks resolved keeping BOTH
  features (attention two-pass overlay + proximity fuse kept; transitions
  validators/fades auto-merged). Its wiki page renumbered 30 -> 31 because
  attention images already claimed page 30.
- `feat/caption-studio-runner` verified already an ancestor of `main` -
  nothing to merge (tracking note was stale).
- Dead `if False and interstitial_slides:` concat path + stale "Phase 46"
  comment removed.
- Verified on main: 728 passed / 1 skipped / 18 xfailed backend tests,
  `tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` green, real-render smoke (dip_black
  boundary luma 2 vs 126 mid-clip, front attention overlay above karaoke
  subs, 6.000s duration invariant), live Step 3 screenshot on pipeline
  "hugo, test" (transition popover + attention lane + subtitle styles).
- Gotcha: full pytest needs `.env` (ElevenLabs key) - a bare worktree fails
  `test_preview_tts_provider_failure_refunds_and_restores_forced_audio`
  with 400-instead-of-503. Port 3001 is now held by a WSL NestJS service;
  web dev verification ran on :3000 against a second backend on :8001.

## 2026-07-19 - Attention Images: Pipeline Step 1 integration + per-variant stagger

- Added a Step 1 picker (`attention-template-picker.tsx`) under Video Idea
  to choose a template + source images once for the whole pipeline, with
  a **Stagger / variant (s)** control (variant *N* shifts by
  `N × staggerSeconds`) and a **Variants (0 = all)** cap.
- Added `PUT /api/v1/pipeline/{id}/attention-selection`, persisted under a
  reserved `_selection` key in `editai_pipelines.attention_timeline`
  (can't collide with numeric preview keys); restored via
  `attention_selection` on `GET /pipeline/scripts/{id}`, including history
  restore and import.
- Added an auto-apply effect in `pipeline/page.tsx`: once a variant has a
  preview and an empty attention timeline, it calls apply-template with
  `startOffsetMs = variantIndex × staggerSeconds × 1000`; hand-edited
  (non-empty) timelines are never overwritten.
- `ApplyAttentionTemplateRequest` gained `startOffsetMs` (0–60000); cues
  are shifted after `distribute_attention_cues` and any cue overflowing
  `durationMs` is dropped.
- Verified: `test_apply_template_start_offset_staggers_and_drops_overflow`
  (backend, 3/3 in file) + `attention-step1-picker.spec.ts` (frontend,
  2/2). Screenshot `attention-step1-picker.png`.
- Gotchas recorded: frontend serves from a standalone Next.js build on
  :3947 (needs `npm run build`, EBUSY if the server process still holds
  `.next/standalone`); backend (:8000) runs without `--reload`; the
  Step 1 + stagger diff is uncommitted, interleaved in `page.tsx` /
  `pipeline_routes.py` with unrelated parallel-session work (segment
  proximity scoring, karaoke `subtitle_styler.py`) and needs hunk-level
  staging plus the mixed-EOL rebuild recipe from
  `goals/attention-images-details.md`.

See [Attention Images: Pipeline Step 1 integration + per-variant stagger](30-attention-images-pipeline-integration.md).

## 2026-07-18 - Shell parity pack — X1 (web ↔ desktop)

- Cross-repo follow-up to S2 (`social-scheduler/goals/design-x1-parity.md`),
  source of truth = web. Made on `feat/timeline-transitions-v1`, touching
  only `navbar.tsx`/`product-switcher.tsx`/`ui/button.tsx` (unrelated
  uncommitted attention-image work on that branch left untouched).
- Media Library icon `Cloud` → `Images`; product-switcher `PRODUCTS`
  descriptions made identical to web's copy (name/description only —
  href/icon stay per-app).
- Nav hover token on inactive items `hover:text-lime` →
  `hover:text-sidebar-accent-foreground` (lime isn't an approved hover
  accent).
- Group-label class copied verbatim from web's `app-nav.tsx`; nav list
  `gap-1` → `gap-0.5`; collapsed rail `pt-6` → `pt-4` and gained
  inter-group dividers (previously none).
- Footer radius `rounded-xl` → `rounded-lg` (switcher trigger, credit
  pill, user card); sidebar wordmark `h-8` → `h-11`.
- Credit widget restyled to match web: `Wallet` → `Zap` in lime + "AI
  Credits Remaining" label, no quota bar (`/platform/me` doesn't return
  one here).
- Icon collision fix: `AI Video` `Clapperboard` → `Film` (new residual
  collision with `Local Exports`'s `Film`, logged in the parity skill
  watchlist, not fixed this pass); `Generate` renamed `Context Video`
  (was colliding with web `/create`'s "Generate").
- `ui/button.tsx` base + sm/lg size radius `rounded-md` → `rounded-lg`.
- Web counterpart in the same session: `app-nav.tsx` active-route match
  made boundary-safe; `ui/button.tsx` default `h-8` → `h-9`.
- Verified: `eslint` + `tsc --noEmit` clean on both repos for the changed
  files. Screenshot `x1-parity-studio-expanded.png` (repo root) against a
  live dev server confirms the rendered result. Collapsed-rail screenshot
  (`x1-parity-studio-collapsed.png`, repo root) captured 2026-07-18 against
  the still-live `:3005` dev server (sidebar collapsed via the
  `blipost.sidebar.collapsed` localStorage key); confirms `pt-4` top
  padding and the inter-group divider lines in the icon rail.

See [Shell, spacing, and icon-sizing sweep (S2)](29-shell-spacing-sweep.md#follow-up-x1-shell-parity-pack-2026-07-18).
## 2026-07-18 - Timeline transitions V1: dip to black + flash white

- Added `transitionIn { kind: dip_black | flash_white, durationMs }` to
  composition clips (frontend type + backend `TimelineEntry`), additive with
  no migration; per-variant `defaultTransition` resolved client-side before
  any request.
- One shared backend validator at every composition ingress (save loop,
  `composition_overrides`, `composition_override`, `_timeline_from_composition`):
  bad kind/duration → 422, out-of-range → clamped [150, 600], intro clips
  stripped; filtergraph args built only from the validated enum + int.
- Render: fade-out/fade-in halves appended to `extract_segment()`'s `-vf`
  chain — timeline duration invariant by construction (real-FFmpeg ffprobe
  test), zero-transition concat `-c copy` fast path untouched; fade specs
  enter the segment cache key only when present (legacy keys byte-identical,
  invalidation limited to adjacent segments). Guards: intro clips, sides
  shorter than 2×duration, interstitial-slide boundaries.
- Step 3 UI: per-variant "Default transition" + "Duration" selects; boundary
  dot markers with popover (Cut / Dip to black / Flash white, duration
  preset, "Use variant default", override state); marker raised to z-40 over
  the z-30 trim handle after live testing caught click interception.
- Instant preview: rAF-driven opacity overlay from the TTS-audio master
  clock (pause/scrub correct, no dual playback); subtitles/attention cues
  sit above and never fade.
- Verified: 711 backend tests green (61 transitions), tsc/eslint/build
  clean, real-render boundary frames (solid black / white, control clean,
  all 6.000000s), live-app screenshots on pipeline "hugo, test".

See [Timeline transitions V1 — dip to black + flash white](31-timeline-transitions-v1.md).

## 2026-07-18 - Pipeline toolbar overlap + heading-consistency fix pack (S1)

- Rebuilt `PipelineStepper`'s toolbar as a plain flex row (context | step
  track `flex-1` | actions) instead of `absolute left-1/2` + fixed
  per-breakpoint widths, fixing the stepper/action-button overlap around
  1100-1300px viewport width.
- Removed the duplicate "Back to Scripts" button in Step 3's mobile header
  (the toolbar ghost button already owns that action).
- Gave every workspace-mode `Card` (7 sites across steps 1-3, source-videos
  card, history sidebar) `bg-background` instead of the default `bg-card`,
  removing the visible seam under the toolbar; factored the fix into a
  shared `WORKSPACE_CARD_BG` constant in `pipeline-utils.tsx`.
- Unified the Step 2/Step 3 sub-header language (`bg-background`, `h-14`).
- Split "Review Scripts (N)" / "Preview & Select Variants (N previews
  shown)" into a heading plus a separate meta line.
- Added `components/page-header.tsx` and migrated the 14 top-level pages
  that were missing `font-heading` on their H1 onto it.
- Added `font-heading` to `CardTitle`'s default className (~40 call sites).

See [Pipeline toolbar overlap + heading-consistency fix pack](28-pipeline-toolbar-heading-fixes.md).

## 2026-07-17 - Pipeline media preview host parity

- Fixed broken Pipeline thumbnails and previews caused by native media URLs
  using `127.0.0.1` while the browser page and media-session cookie used
  `localhost`.
- Added a hydration-safe runtime API URL hook and applied it to Step 3,
  source-video cards, the timeline, the thumbnail picker, variant previews,
  and completed render media.
- Normalized Windows and POSIX thumbnail paths to basename-only segment URLs,
  preventing full `C:\...` paths from being encoded into `<img>` sources.
- Verified TypeScript, focused ESLint, the Windows-path URL helper, the desktop
  media-session tests (4 passed), and CodeGraph synchronization. The standalone
  rebuild remains pending because the running Electron server locked
  `.next/standalone`; no process was terminated.

See [Pipeline media preview host parity](27-pipeline-media-preview-host-parity.md).

## 2026-07-17 - Local BlipCreative to BlipStudio SSO recovery

- Fixed the local Studio platform bridge so it calls the running BlipCreative
  app instead of the production domain, and made the web desktop-auth endpoint
  reuse the same server-only Supabase identity configuration as `/studio`.
- Confirmed that the SSO token was issued and consumed successfully; Supabase
  was healthy and the Auth.js user mapping matched the existing Supabase user.
  The visible "Desktop identity provider is unavailable" message was therefore
  a misleading fallback symptom, not the root cause.
- Found the actual failure after token consumption: the desktop production
  build unconditionally changed a browser launch from `localhost:3947` to
  `127.0.0.1:3947`. That separated Studio from the Auth.js cookie on
  `localhost:3000`, so the Creative-session check invalidated the newly issued
  Studio session and returned the user to login.
- Restricted loopback host pinning to a real Electron renderer
  (`window.editFactory?.isDesktop`). Normal browser SSO now remains on
  `localhost`; native Electron still uses `127.0.0.1` for its backend media
  cookie contract.
- Rebuilt the standalone frontend and relaunched Electron. Verified the auth
  regression check, focused ESLint, TypeScript, production build, frontend and
  backend health, and credentialed CORS from `http://localhost:3947`.

See [Local BlipCreative to BlipStudio SSO recovery](26-local-creative-studio-sso.md).

## 2026-07-17 - Step 3 "Variant Previews" timeline editor rework

- Fixed the Instant Preview frozen playhead (stuck at 0:00, no segment cuts):
  the click-primed `audio.play()` left `audio.paused` transiently false, so
  startup skipped the authoritative `play()` and ran the rAF clock loop against
  audio stuck at 0. Added `playAudioAndStartLoop()` to start the loop only after
  `play()` resolves and clear the playing state on rejection; applied to all
  startup paths and the non-intro resume.
- Removed the duplicate storyboard strip; the multi-track timeline is now the
  single segment view. Relocated its "+" attention-image insert to the Attention
  images lane; all other affordances remain via Video-lane selection + the
  inline panel. Updated the stale strip hint.
- Video lane now renders one clip block per phrase with real SRT boundaries
  (NLE semantics); adjacent same-`merge_group` clips get a subtle linked tint
  and flattened touching corners. `merge_group` data model unchanged. Pin
  indicator relocated onto clips.
- Added a Maximize control per variant card opening a near-fullscreen editor
  that reuses `TimelineEditor` via a new `displayMode="full"` prop.
- Reordered the multi-track lanes to top = topmost visual layer (Subtitles >
  Attention images > Video, then audio). Backend compositor was already correct
  (attention baked before subtitles in `assembly_service.py`); no backend change.
- New wiki page `25-step3-variant-timeline-editor.md`. Verified via clean
  `next build` + `tsc` + `eslint`; live browser verification not feasible
  without a populated pipeline and a running app instance.
- Commits: `116cfac` (preview clock fix), `c082ec5` (storyboard strip removal),
  `bd4fa9b` (per-phrase Video clips), `9c775bd` (lane order), `adb36bf`
  (maximize editor), `fbcff77` (wiki).

## 2026-07-16 - BlipStudio credit metering validated live E2E (Goal D)

- Validated the Studio→web credit metering path end-to-end for the first time
  against a running local web app and its real Postgres ledger (no mocks on the
  metering path), using the real `StudioMeteringClient` and a shared test
  `STUDIO_SERVICE_TOKEN` (local `.env`, uncommitted).
- Scenario A (with credits): reserve debited exactly the rate-card amount
  (`studio.script_pipeline`, 2 credits; balance 100→98) and capture persisted
  the spend (98, `captured`). The local `GEMINI_API_KEY` is invalid, so the
  intended in-Studio AI step failed and exercised the live reserve→refund
  fail-closed path (98→100); capture was proven as a separate live transaction.
- Scenario B (no credits): real `402 insufficient_credits`
  (`available_credits=0`) before any provider work; the live web-mode frontend
  rendered the real 402 billing toast with a **Manage credits** action to
  `https://blipost.com/billing` (screenshot captured).
- Scenario C (desktop mode): deterministic local `desktop:<uuid5>` reservation,
  captured, with zero HTTP calls to the web ledger — early access unbilled and
  unblocked.
- The prior 307 private-mode blocker is fixed on WEB by `ceb5057`. Updated
  `docs/wiki/24-blipstudio-credit-metering.md`: replaced the "Live integration
  blocker" note with the real results. No committed code changed on either repo.

## 2026-07-15 - BlipStudio credit metering (Goal B2)

- Added a fail-closed Studio-to-web metering client with durable idempotent
  reserve/capture/refund state and desktop-only structured usage logging.
- Metered asynchronous Pipeline scripts and per-variant TTS, Pipeline final
  renders/remakes, fixed-five-second Seedance, single/batch product jobs,
  standalone TTS, TTS Library assets, and Library voiceover regeneration,
  including cancellation, failure refund, settlement retry, and restart paths.
- Closed historical web-mode provider/render bypasses with explicit
  desktop-only guards, while preserving those compatibility routes in Electron.
- Added terminal crash-window recovery so a completed capture/refund cannot
  leave a pending job or cause paid provider work to run again after restart.
- Reserved final-render credits before fair queue entry so denied work never
  occupies queue capacity; product composition and encoding share one ticket.
- Added shared friendly HTTP 402 guidance with a billing action across every
  affected UI flow and fixed web Seedance to its five-second rate-card unit;
  Library voiceover render billing is re-quoted from exact generated audio.
- Verification: full backend **652 passed, 1 skipped, 18 xfailed**; focused
  metering **83 passed**; legacy guards **15 passed**; TypeScript, ESLint with
  zero errors, production Next Webpack build/post-build, and three deterministic
  Chromium 402 scenarios passed. No push was performed.
- Live two-app E2E found a Goal B1 blocker: web private mode redirects the
  internal metering routes because `/api/internal/studio` is absent from its
  public API prefixes. The inspected local environments also lack the shared
  service token. B2's web-read-only rule was preserved; the exact fix,
  provisioning, and rerun steps are documented in the page below.

See [BlipStudio credit metering](24-blipstudio-credit-metering.md).

## 2026-07-15 — Fair multi-tenant render queue (Goal C)

- Added a process-local scheduler that dispatches final Pipeline renders in
  round-robin order between users while preserving FIFO inside each user's
  queue and the existing `MAX_CONCURRENT_RENDERS`/FFmpeg semaphore limit.
- Persisted `queued` before background execution; status polling now exposes
  one-based queue position and a recent-duration ETA. Step 4 distinguishes
  queued work from active rendering and permits immediate queued cancellation.
- Made restart behavior honest: persisted queued/processing records whose
  callbacks vanished are marked interrupted/failed and can be submitted again.
- Added scheduler and Pipeline integration tests, a deterministic Step 4
  Playwright transition test, and two browser screenshots.
- Fixed a pre-existing Windows signing-key flake exposed by the full suite:
  binary key material is now persisted with `O_BINARY`, so `0x0A` is never
  converted to CRLF.
- Verification: **564 passed, 1 skipped, 18 xfailed, 0 failed** in the full
  backend suite; TypeScript passed; focused ESLint had zero errors; Playwright
  and browser queue-to-render transition checks passed. No deployment or push
  was performed.

See [Fair multi-tenant render queue](23-render-queue-multi-tenant.md).

## 2026-07-15 — Backend suite green: five pre-existing failures fixed

- Aligned the three `TestTTSGenerate` tests with the multi-provider
  `/tts/generate` contract (`provider`+`voice_id` required; status `processing`).
- Corrected `test_build_output_basename_uses_human_readable_labels` to the
  deliberate 6-word script-slug truncation (the expectation was miscounted).
- Root-caused the `"database is locked"` failure to a leaked SQLite connection:
  `close_repository()` reset the singleton without closing its connection, so an
  orphaned handle held the `data.db` write lock (GC-delayed under coverage). Now
  `close_repository()` closes the backend connection on reset.
- Local-only env fix: installed `python-magic-bin` in the venv because
  `import magic` hung on this Windows machine (`requirements.txt` unchanged —
  prod is Linux/Docker with `libmagic1`). No pytest zombies were present.
- Full backend suite: **555 passed, 1 skipped, 18 xfailed, 0 failed** (~63 s),
  run cap-à-queue with no hacks.

See [BlipStudio web remediation](22-blipstudio-web-remediation.md).

## 2026-07-15 — BlipStudio remediation: post-verification fixes

- Kept the `generate_raw_clips` web-mode guard (a bare `video_path` reads the
  server disk) and updated its test to assert `501` in web mode plus the
  non-503 path under desktop mode.
- Made `GET /segments/browse-local` an always-`501` stub in both modes and
  deleted the dead tkinter `_PICKER_SCRIPT`; the native picker is the Electron
  IPC bridge, so no client calls the HTTP endpoint.
- Removed the `profile_id` parameter from `_get_pipeline_state_lock` so
  `save_matches` and the async-job mutators can no longer resolve two different
  locks for the same pipeline.
- Committed the superseded local-video spec deletions and ignored `.codegraph/`
  tooling state (dropping the tracked `daemon.pid`).
- Migration `054_add_pipeline_async_jobs.sql` remains unapplied — no consecrated
  migration path exists; it is documented to run at deploy.
- Full backend suite: 550 passed, 5 failed (all pre-existing/contention,
  unrelated to these fixes), 1 skipped, 18 xfailed. Frontend `tsc` clean.

See [BlipStudio web remediation](22-blipstudio-web-remediation.md).

## 2026-07-15 — BlipStudio web remediation delivered (phases B–D)

- Made local browse/find segment operations return `501` immediately in web
  mode and kept the controls/behavior available only in Electron.
- Simplified Pipeline Step 1 to footage + Video Idea, with an optional generated
  name, collapsed Advanced settings, and an upload CTA plus hard guard at zero
  segments.
- Moved script generation and per-variant TTS to persisted FastAPI background
  jobs with `202` dispatch, polling, cancellation, parallel TTS start, progress
  per variant, and restoration after refresh or from Pipeline History.
- Serialized job mutation with its per-pipeline DB write so concurrent TTS
  variants cannot regress the persisted map; terminal cancellation now wins
  against a late worker completion.
- Added the additive `generation_job`/`tts_jobs` schema migration without
  applying it to any database.
- Verified 30 backend tests, TypeScript, focused lint with zero errors, and the
  reload/history/progress flows through Playwright MCP on isolated SQLite data.
  No push or deployment was performed.

See [BlipStudio web remediation](22-blipstudio-web-remediation.md).

## 2026-07-15 — BlipStudio production stack prepared (deployment pending approval)

- Replaced the obsolete production override with a standalone Coolify Compose
  stack for the Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, external Supabase, durable
  media workspace, and explicit liveness checks.
- Made the web build fail closed unless desktop/auth bypass flags are false and
  all compiled public settings are present.
- Removed host-port and developer `.env` coupling from production, isolated
  Docker build contexts from local credentials/media, and moved backend writes
  to a named volume while running the API unprivileged.
- Kept Kokoro support while pinning the official CPU-only PyTorch wheel, so a
  CPU production host does not receive unused multi-gigabyte CUDA libraries.
- Updated the production web dependency chain to patched Next.js, Supabase JS,
  WebSocket, and PostCSS releases; moved the image to Node.js 22 as required by
  current Supabase JS; `npm audit --omit=dev` reports zero findings.
- Selected `blipstudio.blipost.com` for the frontend and DNS-only
  `studio-api.blipost.com` for large API uploads. Coolify/DNS creation and
  deployment remain unexecuted pending the required explicit approval.

See [BlipStudio production deployment](21-blipstudio-production-deployment.md).

## 2026-07-14 — Remediere sistem segmente (transforms v2 + curățenie API)

- Executat planul din [analiza sistemului de segmente](18-analiza-segmente.md),
  orchestrat pe 3 fronturi Codex paralele; verificat: 61 teste
  `test_segment_transforms`, 28 `test_api_segments_sqlite`, 18
  `test_assembly_scoring`, tsc frontend fără erori, graf blur-fill validat
  cu un render FFmpeg de probă.
- **Contract nou transforms** (per segment, DB `editai_segments.transforms`):
  `rotation, scale, pan_x, pan_y, flip_h, flip_v, speed (0.25–4.0),
  blur_fill (bool), brightness (-1..1), contrast (0..3), saturation (0..3)`.
  `opacity` ELIMINAT peste tot (era `colorchannelmixer` spre negru, nu
  transparență); valorile vechi din DB sunt ignorate silențios la parse.
- Backend (`segment_transforms.py` + `assembly_service.py`): `speed` cu
  fereastră de extracție conștientă de viteză (`setpts` + trim exact,
  fallback-ul loop-fill existent păstrat; fără `atempo` — extracțiile sunt
  video-only `-an`); `blur_fill` înlocuiește barele negre la zoom-out cu
  fundal blurat din același cadru (split→boxblur→overlay); culoare per
  segment prin `eq` condiționat. Preview și render final împart același
  drum de extracție (paritate păstrată).
- Frontend (`segment-transform-panel` + `global-transform-panel` +
  `video-processing.ts`): slider Speed cu butoane 0.5×/1×/2×, toggle Blur
  fill (activ doar la scale<1), secțiune Color, Pan dezactivat la scale≤1,
  Opacity scos; bulk apply global suportă toate câmpurile (add-mode:
  delta-față-de-identitate pentru scale/speed/contrast/saturation).
- Curățenie API: șters endpoint-ul orfan
  `PUT /projects/{id}/segments/{id}/transforms` + `update_project_segment`
  din toate repo-urile (zero apelanți); `GET /projects/{id}/segments`
  returnează transforms-ul segmentului direct; sanitizer cu allowlist de
  chei + clamping pe range-uri la `PUT /{id}/transforms` și
  `/bulk-transforms` (cheile necunoscute, inclusiv `opacity`, sunt
  eliminate silențios, nu respinse).
- Necesită restart de backend. Amânat (faza 2): crop box desenat pe preview,
  merge/split manual de grupuri pe timeline-ul Step 3.
- Gotcha operațional Codex: sandbox-ul workspace-write acoperă doar cwd-ul
  invocării — lansat din `electron\`, orice scriere în `app/`/`frontend/` e
  respinsă ca read-only; helperul trebuie invocat din rădăcina repo-ului.

## 2026-07-14 — Web-first Creative Studio (analiză, neimplementat)

- Evaluat mutarea editorului desktop într-o secțiune "Creative Studio" pe
  blipost.com, cu compute pe Oracle Cloud, în locul lansării desktop-first
  cu code signing pe Windows/macOS/Linux.
- Verdict: sustenabil — infrastructura server-side de render (coadă
  `render_jobs`, lease atomic, fleet OCI/Hetzner, autoscaler) există deja în
  social-scheduler; motorul de render Python (`blipost_runner.py`) e deja
  byte-echivalent cu runner-ul TS. Efort de portare estimat în săptămâni.
- Identificat lista de schimbări necesare, în ordinea greutății: storage
  (surse video local → R2/OCI Object Storage), auth bridge (Supabase JWT ↔
  Auth.js prin token `blp_`), rutarea render-ului prin coada existentă în
  loc de semaforul FFmpeg local, și eliminarea shell-ului Electron +
  licențierii per-mașină pentru varianta web.
- Verificat costurile Oracle Cloud (API oficial, iulie 2026): fleet ARM A1
  cu scale-to-zero costă efectiv ~$0 idle; rate-card-ul de credite pentru
  render cloud rămâne provizoriu, de calibrat prin benchmark.
- Semnalat singurul blocker juridic nou introdus de varianta web: generarea
  TTS ElevenLabs backend-side într-un SaaS poate necesita acord OEM/
  Enterprise (pe desktop era cheia userului).
- Recomandare: nu rescrie backend-ul în TypeScript — montează FastAPI ca
  serviciu intern lângă social-scheduler, desktop-ul rămâne opțiune
  ulterioară ("render gratuit pe mașina ta").

## 2026-07-14 — AI auto-segmentation (design, neimplementat)

- Analizat starea modelelor video (Gemini 2.5/3, Grok, Twelve Labs) pentru
  alegerea automată a segmentelor; LLM-urile localizează temporal slab
  (~60%), deci nu cerem timestamps de la AI.
- Decis arhitectura hibridă: FFmpeg shot detection (granițe) + pHash dedup
  + Gemini pentru etichetare/selecție diversă → rânduri în
  `editai_segments`; pipeline-ul din aval rămâne neschimbat.
- Estimare: câteva zile; partea delicată e calibrarea promptului de
  selecție. De implementat ulterior.

See [AI auto-segmentation (idee, neimplementat)](17-ai-auto-segmentation.md).

## 2026-07-13 — Desktop authentication and startup recovery

- Unified website and desktop authentication on the same Supabase identity and
  application-profile ownership contract.
- Forced real authentication into the compiled desktop bundle and included the
  build policy in standalone freshness detection.
- Removed the post-login state/navigation race and allowed a small JWT clock
  skew during backend verification.
- Replaced the authenticated `/` server redirect that caused React error #310
  during session restoration.
- Added second-instance service recovery and persistent renderer diagnostics.
- Recorded the required provider order, production regression flow, and
  incident diagnostic checklist.

See [Desktop authentication and startup recovery](16-desktop-auth-startup-recovery.md).

## 2026-07-13 — ElevenLabs tenant governance

- Izolat vocile private ale subscripției comune prin atribuiri per profil;
  vocile publice `premade` și `default` rămân disponibile tuturor.
- Adăugat un ledger lunar per profil, cu rezervări atomice înainte de request
  și reconciliere după costul exact raportat de ElevenLabs.
- Separat cheile BYOK de bugetul platformei și ascuns soldul/cheia centrală din
  endpointul și badge-ul folosite de utilizator.
- Adăugat administrare pentru atribuiri și limite, erori explicite de policy,
  migrare Supabase/SQLite și teste de concurență.

See [ElevenLabs: voci izolate și credite per profil](15-elevenlabs-tenant-governance.md).

## 2026-07-13 — Pipeline source-video prerequisite

- Extracted the Pipeline Source Videos selector into a shared card used by
  Steps 1 and 2 without changing the four-step workflow.
- Surfaced available video material while users write the idea and configure
  script generation.
- Added an actionable warning when no material exists, with a direct link to
  Segments, while keeping script generation available.
- Added Playwright coverage and screenshots for Step 1 placement, the empty
  state action, and the non-blocking Generate Scripts behavior.

See [Session navigation cache](10-session-navigation-cache.md).

## 2026-07-13 — Pre-launch cosmetic pass

- Hid legacy Postiz/Buffer config cards in Settings behind a collapsed
  "Legacy integrations" section (`SHOW_LEGACY_INTEGRATIONS` flag); Schedule
  and Calendar remain fully functional on the Postiz backend.
- Renamed "Clips" to "Local Projects" in the sidebar nav and the Library
  page title (route `/librarie` unchanged), reducing the naming collision
  with the web app's AI clipping pipeline.
- Added a "Free — renders on your machine" caption under the primary
  render button in Pipeline Step 3.
- Updated the `blipost-parity` skill: closed the theme-propagation
  watchlist item and logged the Clips rename.

See [Pre-launch cosmetic pass](14-pre-launch-cosmetics.md).

## 2026-07-12 â€” AI Video with Seedance 2.0

- Added Seedance 2.0 text-to-video generation through the existing FAL credential flow.
- Download completed MP4s locally, then register each asset in both Source Videos and Library.
- Added the AI Video workspace and documented how generated clips retain the normal editing, voiceover, caption, and social publishing workflows.

See [AI Video with Seedance 2.0](13-ai-video-seedance.md).

## 2026-07-12 â€” Pacing control and timeline card labels

- Added persisted Fast/Normal/Slow Step 3 pacing that re-runs preview matching
  and is shared with preview rendering and final rendering.
- Replaced visible phrase-index timeline labels with content-focused labels and
  compact duration metadata while retaining indices in hover tooltips.

See [Preview/render segment parity](12-preview-render-parity.md).

## 2026-07-12 — Preview/render segment parity

- Matched library footage once per merge group and expanded the shared selection to per-phrase preview data.
- Added overlap-aware visual clusters, cooldown relaxation reporting, and an amber low-variety warning in Step 3.

See [Preview/render segment parity](12-preview-render-parity.md).
## 2026-07-12 - Step-3 MP4 subtitle-style fidelity

- Changed the variant-preview MP4 request to submit the resolved A/B subtitle-style object shown by the editor, including karaoke fields.
- Kept the Meta visual version for segment selection and cache addressing while preventing a second backend Meta overlay from replacing the submitted style.
- Preserved the legacy backend fallback for non-Step-3 callers and verified the focused preview/frame tests plus the frontend typecheck.

See [Subtitle preview scaling](09-subtitle-preview-scaling.md).

## 2026-07-12 — Subtitle frame-preview parity verification

- Measured the exact frame-preview and preview-render FFmpeg chains with FontSize=107; both preserve the same glyph-to-frame ratio.
- Confirmed the frame-preview endpoint keeps `original_size=1080x1920`, matching the render path, and that the frontend sends raw font-size values.
- Reactivated and updated the endpoint regression test to guard the shared subtitle reference.

See [Subtitle preview scaling](09-subtitle-preview-scaling.md).

## 2026-07-12 — Session navigation cache

- Added a profile-scoped, renderer-memory cache to the shared API client so data already loaded by any sidebar section is reused when returning to it.
- Excluded live status, progress, health, log, and event reads from the cache.
- Cleared the shared cache after every API write to keep subsequent page visits authoritative.
- Preserved Pipeline source videos across the Pipeline → Segments → Pipeline flow and kept their cache fresh after source-video library changes.
- Restored the selected source video when returning to Segments through the sidebar.

See [Session navigation cache](10-session-navigation-cache.md).

## 2026-07-11 — Desktop application health audit

- Made API tests independent of the developer's SQLite database and updated stale tests to the repository, encoding, subtitle, scoring, and desktop-path contracts.
- Restored Next.js 16 lint compliance, isolated `.next-dev` output from ESLint, and verified lint/typecheck plus a production standalone build.
- Aligned the desktop pairing copy with the web Settings heading and added accessible names to the bridge controls.
- Changed desktop unpairing to revoke the web runner before deleting its local token; offline failures keep the token so the action can be retried.
- Moved the conditional ML gate before repository access so rejected voice-mute requests do not touch SQLite.
- Recorded the remaining dirty-overlap blockers and the safe Electron bundle restoration procedure.

See [Desktop application health audit](08-desktop-health-audit.md).

## 2026-07-11 — Segments editor video and timeline redesign

- Rebuilt the source-video player with the source aspect ratio, integrated controls, and a non-overlaying black playback bar.
- Replaced the flat timeline with a filmstrip, centered waveform, numbered segment ranges, time labels, and a high-contrast playhead.
- Changed the waveform to neutral gray outside saved segments and lime only inside saved ranges.
- Made Source Videos, the center editor, Segments Library, and the video/timeline split resizable.
- Reworked deleted-segment undo so `Ctrl+Z` remains retryable after an API failure and restores important segment metadata.
- Added a visible Undo action after deletion and corrected the delete confirmation copy.

See [Segments editor: video, timeline, resizing, and undo](07-segments-editor-timeline.md).

## 2026-07-11 — Desktop startup and subtitle preview first paint

- Removed the implicit production frontend build from Electron `start`/`dev`; desktop startup no longer fails when Google Fonts cannot be downloaded.
- Added shared first-layout and `ResizeObserver` measurement for subtitle previews.
- Migrated subtitle and timeline editors to the shared reactive measurement hook.
- Added regression coverage for synchronous first-paint height and later resize updates.

See [Desktop startup and subtitle preview reliability](06-desktop-preview-reliability.md).

## 2026-07-12 — Subtitle preview scaling

- Unified the CSS subtitle scaling contract around one 1920px reference height and a shared minimum-aware helper.
- Timeline overlays now consume ResizeObserver-backed container height and re-scale in compact and expanded previews.
- Kept backend subtitle rendering unchanged as the pixel ground truth.

See [Subtitle preview scaling](09-subtitle-preview-scaling.md).

## 2026-07-12 — Subtitle Style panel restructure

- Large sticky A/B preview cards (click to select which Meta version you edit) replacing the small previews with dead space below.
- Drag-to-position: subtitle text draggable vertically on the active preview, mapped to positionY.
- Controls regrouped into Text / Position / Effects; duplicated heading removed; RO helper text translated.
- Full-width font picker with per-option font rendering; Load system fonts as adjacent button.
- Saved presets unified into the visual preset grid (delete affordance, Apply preset dropdown removed) and applied to the active A/B version.
- Karaoke-only Highlight Color control added (backend highlightColor was previously unreachable).

See [Subtitle Style panel](11-subtitle-style-panel.md).

## 2026-07-12 — Expanded preview subtitle under-scaling

- Split the shared preview height measurement into per-view hook instances (compact vs expanded) with a callback-ref observer, fixing subtitles rendering ~2.3x too small in the Expanded Preview dialog.

See [Subtitle preview scaling](09-subtitle-preview-scaling.md).
